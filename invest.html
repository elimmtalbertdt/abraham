                <h3>Find a Broker</h3>
                <p> To find a trusted broker, first check if they are regulated by recognized
                    authorities like the SEC, FCA, or ASIC. Next, review their trading platform for 
                    usability and features. Then, research fees and commissions to ensure transparency.
                    Look for customer reviews and ratings to gauge reputation. Finally, test their service with 
                    a demo account before committing real money to confirm reliability and support.<p>
