                <h3>Apple</h3>
                <p>Apple is a strong long-term investment due to its global brand, loyal customer base, 
                    and integrated product ecosystem. Its hardware (iPhones, Macs) and services (Apple Music, iCloud, App Store) 
                    work together to create stable, recurring revenue. Apple has over $160 billion in cash, allowing it to invest
                     in R&D and return value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Its recent push into AI with “Apple Intelligence” 
                     and potential future devices like the Vision Pro headset may open new growth opportunities. However, there are valid concerns. 
                     Apple still relies heavily on iPhone sales, which are vulnerable to economic downturns and market saturation. About 20% of revenue 
                     comes from China, where demand is slowing and regulatory risks are rising. Apple also faces antitrust investigations, especially regarding 
                     its App Store policies. These could result in legal restrictions or fines. In short, Apple is a financially sound, innovation-driven company,
                      but it faces headwinds from regulation, slowing hardware growth, and global market risks.<p>

                <h3>Nvidia</h3>
                <p>NVIDIA is a leader in the booming AI and data center sectors. Its high-performance GPUs, like the H100 and B200, 
                    power AI systems used by Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. In Q2 2025, NVIDIA reported over $25 billion in revenue, much of it
                     from AI infrastructure. The company also dominates the gaming GPU market and is expanding into automotive and robotics. Its CUDA 
                     software platform gives it a competitive edge. Still, there are risks. NVIDIA’s valuation is extremely high, with a P/E ratio over 70, 
                     which assumes continued explosive growth. If AI demand slows or competitors catch up—such as AMD, Intel, or companies using custom chips—stock 
                     performance may suffer. U.S. export controls on chips to China also threaten future sales. Additionally, AI hype may not translate into sustained 
                     earnings if adoption plateaus. NVIDIA is an attractive buy for long-term growth investors betting on AI, but the current price reflects a lot of 
                     optimism. Any stumble in earnings or chip demand could lead to sharp corrections.<p>

                <h3>Google</h3>
                <p>Alphabet, Google’s parent company, benefits from dominance in search, YouTube, Android, and a 
                    fast-growing cloud business. Its Gemini AI models and DeepMind research put it at the forefront of AI development. 
                    Alphabet also holds significant stakes in emerging tech through Waymo (self-driving) and Verily (health tech). In Q2 2025, 
                    its cloud division posted strong profits, and its ad business remains a global leader. The company also has a strong balance sheet, 
                    with over $120 billion in cash and low debt. However, Alphabet faces challenges. It is under pressure from regulators in the U.S. and 
                    Europe over antitrust concerns, especially related to Google Search and YouTube. Its core advertising revenue is vulnerable to economic 
                    slowdowns and increasing competition from Amazon, Meta, and TikTok. Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI has also cut into its AI and search 
                    leadership. While Alphabet offers diversification and innovation, short-term risks from regulation and AI competition could limit near-term growth. 
                    It's a smart long-term investment for those betting on AI, cloud, and digital services—but it’s not risk-free.<p>
