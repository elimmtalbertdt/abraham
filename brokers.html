                        <h2>FTX</h2>
                        <p>FTX was a major cryptocurrency exchange known for offering derivatives, spot trading, 
                            and tokenized assets with low fees and advanced features. Founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, 
                            it quickly rose in popularity before collapsing in 2022 due to alleged fraud,
                            misuse of customer funds, and lack of internal controls. The company filed for bankruptcy, 
                            and Bankman-Fried was later convicted on multiple criminal charges.<p>
