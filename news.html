                        <h2>Nvidia sky rockets</h2>
                        <p>Nvidia’s stock soared to a record $155 in June 2025, 
                            driven by its leadership in AI chips and eased U.S.-China trade tensions. 
                            The company’s partnerships and new AI products boosted investor confidence, 
                            pushing its market value past $3.7 trillion. Analysts predict Nvidia could 
                            soon hit $4 trillion. Despite insiders selling over $1 billion in shares, Nvidia
                            remains a top AI stock with strong growth potential.
                             The scale of Nvidia’s growth reflects broader trends in the AI and semiconductor sectors,
                            where demand for high-performance computing continues to skyrocket. As cloud providers, automakers, 
                            and even defense industries adopt Nvidia’s chips, the company benefits from diversified revenue streams
                            and global demand. With a dominant position in GPU-based AI infrastructure and expanding software
                            ecosystems like CUDA and Omniverse, Nvidia has become essential to the AI supply chain.
                            The company’s size and influence now rival the likes of Apple and Microsoft, and its ability to 
                            weather macroeconomic shifts and international policy changes makes it a cornerstone of long-term 
                            tech investment.<p>

                        <h2>New USA tariffs hit hard</h2>
                        <p>In 2025, many major companies like Nike, Walmart, Shein, 
                            and Ford announced price increases due to President Trump’s tariffs,
                            which added a 10% tax on most imports and higher rates on goods from countries 
                            like China and Vietnam. These tariffs increased costs across industries such as retail,
                            auto, and electronics. Businesses are raising prices selectively to offset higher 
                            import costs, causing consumers to face higher prices on many imported products.
                            The scale of the impact is significant, as these companies source large portions of 
                            their inventory and materials from abroad. For example, Nike and Shein depend heavily
                            on low-cost manufacturing in Asia, while Walmart imports a wide range of consumer goods. 
                            Ford, like other automakers, relies on global supply chains for parts and assembly. With
                            tariffs affecting billions of dollars' worth of goods, even a 10% increase translates to
                            billions in added costs across the economy. These added costs are often passed on to consumers, 
                            leading to inflationary pressure, particularly in budget-sensitive sectors like clothing, footwear,
                            and household electronics.<p>
